_"Because a little ~~auk~~   Awk can go a long way."_

This repository holds all the code (and web pages) for the awk community portal, http://awk.info.

The  repository including single functions, groups of related functions, preprocessors and language variants.

Note that, optionally, code in this repository can be pretty-printed for display on the web. For example,  the source code for
[join.awk](http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/gawk/array/join.awk) is pretty-printed at http://awk.info/?gawk/array/join.awk. To enable that display, see the notes at the end of [README.txt](http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/README.txt)
