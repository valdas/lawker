## Welcome ##
to 'lawker', a place to get tested AWK code that you can use rather than re-invent the wheel.


### Repository structure ###

Instead of the usual 'trunk', 'tags', 'branches' organization, we structured the subversion repository in keeping with the 'locker' theme.

  * lawker/
    * lawker/block (instead of branches), where code gets "hacked up"
    * lawker/freezer (instead of tags), where good code is frozen
    * lawker/fridge (instead of trunk), where the code is fresh and ready to serve
